# This is a simple refactoring exercise.
#
# What to do?
#
# 1. Look at the code of the class CorrectAnswerBehavior
# 2. Try to see what it does by running `ruby refactoring_example.rb`
# 3. Record characterisation tests by running `ruby refactoring_example.rb --record`
# 4. Make the code beautiful;)
# 5. You are allowed to modify only the code between markers (REFACTORING START/REFACTORING END).
# 6. Test must pass! You can run them with command `ruby refactoring_example.rb --test`
# 7. For suggestions of other exercises based on this code...
#     a) Follow http://twitter.com/programmingwod or
#     b) like https://www.facebook.com/ProgrammingWorkout or
#     c) signup to http://programmingworkout.com
#
# Usage:
#  ruby refactoring_example.rb [-h|--help|help]       - shows help screen.
#  ruby refactoring_example.rb [-c|--clean|clean]     - clean recorded results of simulation.
#  ruby refactoring_example.rb [-r|--record|record]   - records 5000 results of simulation.
#  ruby refactoring_example.rb [-t|--test|test]       - tests against 5000 recorded results of simulation.
#  ruby refactoring_example.rb <ANY_NUMBER>           - shows result of simulation initialized with <ANY_NUMBER>.
#  ruby refactoring_example.rb                        - shows result of random simulation.
